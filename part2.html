                <h3>1. Theravada</h3>
                <p>Theravada is the prevalent form of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar.
                    Its vast collection of scriptures are known as the Pali Canon, Pali being their language.
                    Often considered closer to the original teachings of the Buddha,
                    Theravada emphasizes the attainment of personal enlightenment (<i>nirvana</i>).
                    Thervada has greatly influcenced the Insight Meditaion movement in the West.

                <h3>2. Mahayana</h3>
                <p>Mahayana is the prevalent form of Buddism in China, Korea, Japan, and Vietnam.
                    Mahayana scripture is largely known through Sanskrit manuscripts.
                    In contrast to Theravada, Mahayana emphasizes the <i>Bodhisattva</i> ideal,
                    wherein one seeks enlightenment out of compassionate desire to aid in the enlightenment of all beings.
                    Major schools of Mahayana include Zen and Pure Land.

                <p>
                    Vajrayana is the prevalent form of Buddhism in Tibet, Bhutan, and Mongolia.
                    Also known as <i>Tantric</i> Buddhism, Vajrayana is sometimes considered a type of, or complement to, Mahayana Buddhism.
                    Vajrayana is known for its complex rituals and visualization-based meditation techniques.
                    This is the form of Buddhism practiced by spiritual leader of Tibet and pop culture icon The Dalai Llama.
